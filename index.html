<h3>Robots are controlled by a computer program or
     electronic circuitry. They may be directly 
     controlled by humans. They may be designed to 
     look like humans, in which case their
      behaviour may suggest intelligence or
       thought but they do not have feelings.</h3>

    <p>Robots eliminate dangerous jobs for humans 
        because they are capable of working in 
        hazardous environments. They can handle 
        lifting heavy loads, toxic substances and
        repetitive tasks. eg - machines used in companies</p>

            <p>There are many other examples of 
                intelligent technology gone bad,
                 but more often than not they 
                 involve deception rather than 
                 physical danger. Malevolent bots,
                  designed by criminals, are now 
                  ubiquitous on social media sites 
                  and elsewhere online. </p>
